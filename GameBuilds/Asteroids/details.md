# Asteroids

## Description

A very simple, and, to be frank, very crappy implementation of an asteroid arcade game.
I think I wrote this my first year in GTI. It may have been my first try at HTML5 games,
and it shows it. As flawed as the game loop and animation system might be, I did make this
game, and it works.
